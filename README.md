# 🧑‍💼 Dynamic Employee Card

A beautiful and fully dynamic web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to input employee information (name, role, photo, etc.), and it automatically creates a responsive and styled employee card — all generated dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

If no input is provided, a **default employee card** is generated automatically.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Dynamic card creation using pure JavaScript  
✅ Default card when no data is entered  
✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes  
✅ Clean and modern UI design  
✅ Beginner-friendly code with clear structure  
✅ No external libraries – just HTML, CSS, and JS

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User fills in employee details (e.g., name, position, image URL).  
2. On submission, a new card is dynamically created and appended to the web page.  
3. If the user submits without data, a **default employee card** is displayed.  
4. All elements (`div`, `img`, `p`, etc.) are created dynamically via **JavaScript DOM** methods.
